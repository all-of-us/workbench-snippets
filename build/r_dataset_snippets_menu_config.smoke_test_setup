# This cohort was created using Dataset Builder on 12/26/2021.
#
# Feel free to update it with a new/different cohort, but please follow these two caveats:
#  1) Keep the number of members below 5000 so that the smoke test runs relatively quickly.
#  2) Update dataset prefixes from values like 'dataset_123456789' to 'YOUR_DATASET_NAME'.
#     In practice, users of the snippets will do the opposite replacement, but here we want to
#     check that the snippets are consistently using the 'YOUR_DATASET_NAME' prefix.
